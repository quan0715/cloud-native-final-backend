      # you will need to set up different secrets in GitHub (e.g., PROD_EC2_HOST, BETA_EC2_HOST)
      # and then conditionally pass them here based on github.ref_name.
      # This example assumes they use the same set of secrets for simplicity.

      # GITHUB_TOKEN is implicitly passed if the calling workflow has access to it and the called workflow needs it.
      # For docker/login-action to GHCR, it's typically handled well.
